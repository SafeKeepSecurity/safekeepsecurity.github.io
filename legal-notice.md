# Safekeep Cybersecurity's Privacy Policy



---



This privacy policy sets out how [safekeep cybersecurity](https://safekeepsecurity.com) collects, uses, and 

protects any information that you either explicitly or automatically 

send when using this website. Us at safekeepsecurity.com are deeply concerned 

with your privacy as a visitor of this website, and the following 

sections will give details about how any and all data is handled.



### What this site collects:



For the most part this site is read-only, however there are a number of 

functions that can and do collect information as a function of what they are. 



### Cookies Data: 



Regular use of the Internet involves the sending and receiving of cookie data, 

and this is true for this site as well. No special attempt to harvest 

cookie data is being made on this site, and no attempt is ever made to 

correlate visitor data with real people or identities. DISQUS does some 

of this as a normal part of its functionality, which is discussed above 

and in its privacy policy below, but this is unrelated to this site.



### IP Data:



Another natural part of Internet use is the sending of source IP data 

to the destination server—in this case, safekeepsecurity.com. Just as with

cookie data, no attempt is ever made to link source IP addresses to 

people. The only way source IP data is used on this site is indirectly 

by analytics frameworks that are part of the web stack. Each of these 

will be mentioned below, with links to their privacy policies.



### Ads:



Our team uses a sponsorship rather than an ad model, so there is no ad 

JavaScript running anywhere. It’s just the link in the sidebar of each 

post.



Here I will cover how logs are handled, which may contain both cookie and IP address data.



Access to the site is logged in a standard fashion using the web server logs 

(Apache in this case). These logs may contain cookie and IP address data,

as is standard with most web log formats.



Access to this server is restricted to very few people (myself and one other person), and log 

data has never been requested—nor provided to—any third party.



As mentioned earlier, no log data will ever be used to attempt to link 

cookies or IP addresses to actual people, and this log data will never 

be provided to third parties under any circumstances.
