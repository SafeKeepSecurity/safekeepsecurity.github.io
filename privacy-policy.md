This
 privacy policy sets out how safekeepsecurity.com collects, uses, and 
protects any information that you either explicitly or automatically 
send when using this website. Us at safekeepsecurity.com are deeply concerned 
with your privacy as a visitor of this website, and the following 
sections will give details about how any and all data is handled.

What this site collectsFor
 the most part this site is read-only, however there are a number of 
functions that can and do collect information as a function of what they
 are. These include:

Cookies Data: Regular 
use of the Internet involves the sending and receiving of cookie data, 
and this is true for this site as well. No special attempt to harvest 
cookie data is being made on this site, and no attempt is ever made to 
correlate visitor data with real people or identities. DISQUS does some 
of this as a normal part of its functionality, which is discussed above 
and in its privacy policy below, but this is unrelated to this site.
IP Data:
 Another natural part of Internet use is the sending of source IP data 
to the destination server—in this case, safekeepsecurity.com. Just as with
 cookie data, no attempt is ever made to link source IP addresses to 
people. The only way source IP data is used on this site is indirectly 
by analytics frameworks that are part of the web stack. Each of these 
will be mentioned below, with links to their privacy policies.
Ads:
 Our team uses a sponsorship rather than an ad model, so there is no ad 
JavaScript running anywhere. It’s just the link in the sidebar of each 
post.
What we do with collected dataHere I will cover how logs are handled, which may contain both cookie and IP address data.

Access
 to the site is logged in a standard fashion using the web server logs 
(Apache in this case). These logs may contain cookie and IP address data,
 as is standard with most web log formats.

Access to this server 
is restricted to very few people (myself and one other person), and log 
data has never been requested—nor provided to—any third party. The 
server itself is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted with AWS.

As
 mentioned earlier, no log data will ever be used to attempt to link 
cookies or IP addresses to actual people, and this log data will never 
be provided to third parties under any circumstances.

Site Security and Log DataWhile
 it’s not possible to guarantee this site’s security (and you should be 
cautious of anyone who offers such a claim), a great number of measures 
have been taken to ensure that this server cannot be penetrated without 
authorization. These include the use of limited accounts, regular 
security updates, regular security assessments, and the use of hardened 
remote access options.

Third Party Functionality and Privacy PoliciesIn this section I will provide the privacy information for four (4) key third parties that this site has a relationship with:

GDPRWe

not believe that we have any specific GDPR challenges. If you are from 
the EU, however, and have any questions about anything above, please

compliant with the law.
